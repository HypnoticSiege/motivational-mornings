# Motivational Mornings
Welcome to Motivational Mornings. A self-hosted service to help you wake up a tiny bit better in the morning. Get a nice text message with the current day, weather, and a joke or quote to start off the day! (With a soon public version with a web interface/dashboard so you don't need to host it yourself.)

## What is it?
Motivational Mornings is aimed at those who may find it rough to wake up in the morning. It serves as a little "companion" one could say to get you up on the right side of bed. This project will be updated regularly with more features or optimization.

## Technologies Used
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.dev/) to run server-side JavaScript
-  [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to send SMS messages
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/) to store jokes & quotes

## Installation
1. Download all files and Unzip them.
2. Ensure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.dev/)  installed to run the project.
3. Rename `config.sample.js` to `config.js` and edit it to your liking.
4. Open a new command prompt and type `node .` to start the process.
5. Enjoy!

## Work in Progress (WIP)
- Actual functioning weather (Just mock currently)
- Motivational Quotes in message
- Configuration option for quote, joke or both
- Time configuration (Currently runs everyday at 6am EST)
- Web Dashboard/Interface for a public hosted version
